# DataforgedGen

Dataforged Gen is a project that's designed to help people generate JSON data for custom Ironsworn content. The JSON data that it exports is a slightly stripped down version of Rsek's Dataforged format.

I started this project in support of a future update to my other project TheOracle bot so that people could have an easy way to generate and add custom content when that feature rolls out.

You can find a link to the site here: [DataforgedGen](https://xenotropicdev.github.io/DataforgedGen/).

If you have a lot of things you want to convert you might want to check out the main Dataforged repo. There are some tools in there that might be able to help you convert what you have into the proper formats in a more automatic way.

* Import JSON for editing
